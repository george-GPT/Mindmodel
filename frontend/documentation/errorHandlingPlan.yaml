error_handling_strategy:
  purpose: "Implement a consistent, centralized, and streamlined error handling approach across the frontend application to enhance maintainability and clarity."

  current_issues:
    - "Error handling logic is scattered across different components and slices."
    - "Inconsistent error messages and handling patterns."
    - "Redundant or duplicated error handling code."
    - "Confusion over where to handle different types of errors (global vs. field errors)."

  Planning_Considerations:
    - **Centralization of Error Handling:**
        - "Manage all error states within a single `errorSlice` in Redux."
        - "Use a unified format for representing errors."
    - **Consistency in Error Handling:**
        - "Standardize error handling patterns across the application."
        - "Implement consistent error messages and codes."
    - **Separation of Concerns:**
        - "Keep error handling logic separate from business logic and API calls."
        - "Use Error Boundary components for catching render errors."
    - **Simplification and Clarity:**
        - "Avoid overcomplicating error handling mechanisms."
        - "Provide clear documentation and guidelines."

  structure:
    📁src:
      📁store:
        📁slices:
          ├── errorSlice.ts       # Manages global and field-specific error states
          └── index.ts            # Aggregates and exports all slices

        ├── rootReducer.ts        # Combines all Redux slices into a single root reducer
        └── store.ts              # Configures and exports the Redux store with middleware and persistence

      📁components:
        📁ErrorBoundary:          # Error boundary component for catching render errors
          ├── ErrorBoundary.tsx   # Error boundary implementation
          └── index.ts            # Exports the ErrorBoundary component

      📁utils:
        ├── errorHandler.ts       # Centralized error handling utilities
        └── validation.ts         # Validation logic for form inputs and data

      📁types:
        ├── error.d.ts            # Error-related types and interfaces
        └── index.ts              # Aggregates and exports all type definitions

  rules:
    - "Centralize error state management within the `errorSlice`."
    - "Use `ErrorBoundary` components for catching unhandled exceptions during rendering."
    - "Keep error handling logic separate from business logic and API layers."
    - "Standardize error formats and messages for consistency."
    - "Utilize consistent naming conventions for error handling files and functions."

  implementation:
    steps:
      1: "Enhance the `errorSlice` to manage all error states, including global errors, field errors, and loading states."
      2: "Implement an `ErrorBoundary` component to catch and display render-time errors, preventing the entire app from crashing."
      3: "Create utility functions in `errorHandler.ts` to handle errors in a standardized way across the application."
      4: "Separate validation logic into `validation.ts` to handle form and input validation consistently."
      5: "Ensure that all components and services utilize the centralized error handling mechanisms provided."
      6: "Standardize error messages, codes, and formats across the application for consistency."
      7: "Update all import paths and usages to reflect the new error handling structure and eliminate redundant code."
      8: "Thoroughly test the error handling mechanisms to ensure they capture and handle errors as expected."
      9: "Document the error handling strategy and guidelines to assist current and future developers."

  notes:
    - "Centralizing error handling reduces redundancy and confusion, making it easier to manage and debug errors."
    - "Separating error handling from business logic enhances maintainability and clarity."
    - "Consistent error messages and formats improve the user experience and facilitate debugging."
    - "Adhering to this strategy will streamline error handling, allowing developers to focus on core functionality."
